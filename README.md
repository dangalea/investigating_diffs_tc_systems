# Investigating differences between Tropical Cyclone detection systems

This repo contains the code used to produce the results in the paper "Investigating differences between Tropical Cyclone detection systems" accepted (but still not published) by AMS's Artificial Intelligence for the Earth Systems. Please feel free to use this to confirm the results in the manuscript and you can reach out to me at galea.daniel18@gmail.com if you have any questions.

The code is available on Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/records/6595117 and can be cited as "Daniel Galea, Kevin Hodges, & Bryan N. Lawrence. (2022).
